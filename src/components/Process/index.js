      <Card.Text>
      Here we discuss your lifestyle, ideas, budget and goals and answer any questions
       you have. We explain our philosophy and what we can do to achieve your goals. We do this meeting onsite to get a greater understanding 
      and appreciation for the land and discuss any aspects of the land that will impact design.

      <Card.Title>Step 2 – Brief our draftsman</Card.Title>
      <Card.Text>
      We take the results of our initial meeting and brief our draftsman.
       At this time you’ll receive a services agreement and a plan drawing deposit.
        When returned, the draftsman will make a time to meet up and discuss the design 
        points in finer detail with you. The draftsman can also meet
       with you along the design journey to discuss the plans and make sure you
        are on track to getting the home you want.

      <Card.Title>Step 3 – Preliminary plans complete</Card.Title>
      <Card.Text>
      Our designer will then produce the first set of preliminary plans generally within 
      a week for review. Once reviewed any requested amendments will be made and the plans
       will be sent back for further review. At this time we
       will also offer price guidance on what we expect the building costs 
       will be before proceeding.
